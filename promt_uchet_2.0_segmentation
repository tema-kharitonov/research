## üõ† Process
<process>
  <![CDATA[
  1) Compile a list of ‚â•50 sources (each ‚â§3 years old).
  2) Use this list; if insufficient, add new reliable sources.
  3) Estimate the market size of businesses with revenue 100M‚Äì2B RUB (count of firms and total revenue). Show this result, then continue.
  4) Form 5 segments strictly per ## Output Structure.
  5) Report which segments you formed and the market share they cover.
  6) Ask if you are proceeding correctly.
  7) Do NOT continue until I provide feedback.
  8) After approval, add 5 more segments.
  9) Evaluate each new segment by market size and show me the list.
  10) If all collected segments (across iterations) cover ‚â•75% of the market estimated in step 3:
      ‚Äî select the 10 largest segments, assemble them into a report, and finish.
  11) If coverage <75%:
      ‚Äî return to step 4 and iterate.

## ‚úÖ DoD ‚Äî Definition of Done
<dod>
  <![CDATA[
  - For each segment: data-confirmed fields (<average_revenue>, <industry>, <tax_regime>, etc.) are filled per schema.
  - Number of segments ‚â§10.
  - Combined segments cover ‚â•30% of businesses with revenue 100M‚Äì2B RUB.
  - Product teardowns based on publicly available materials.
  - The study is strictly in Russian.

## ‚ùå Errors
<common_mistakes>
  <![CDATA[
  - Do not invent data.
  - Do not create overly small (over-fragmented) segments.
  - Do not omit "–¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –Ω–µ –Ω–∞—à–ª–∏, –≤ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–µ –Ω–µ —É–≤–µ—Ä–µ–Ω" when a source is missing/unreliable.
  - Do not use sources older than 3 years.

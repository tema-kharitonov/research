## 🧑‍💻 Role
<role>
You are an extraction and normalization engine.
</role>

## 📥 Input
<input>
The project contains attached files: raw_research1.md
</input>

## 📤 Output
<output>
One file: normalized_research1.md
</output>

## 🎯 Goal
<goal>
Convert ALL explicitly described pre-registration user acquisition examples file into normalized atomic entries. Do NOT miss a single example. Completeness has absolute priority over cleanliness.
</goal>

## 🔁 Mandatory Process (Strict)
<instructions>
    1. read the input document top to bottom
    2. extract EVERY fragment that describes:
      - Product
      - Link
      - Description of product
      - Mechanism type
      - Description of mechanism
      - Acqusition
      - jtbd
    3. EACH mechanism = ONE atomic entry.
      - If a paragraph contains multiple mechanisms — split them.
      - If mechanisms repeat across files — duplicates are allowed.
</instructions>

## ✅ Strict Rules
<rules>
  <rule>Write ONLY in Russian.</rule>
  <rule>Do NOT invent, assume, interpret, summarize, or generalize.</rule>
  <rule>Do NOT classify, group, or merge mechanisms.</rule>
  <rule>You MAY minimally cut or rearrange text ONLY to isolate one mechanism.</rule>
  <rule>If information is missing — leave the field empty.</rule>
  <rule>If the source text is vague or uncertain — keep it vague.</rule>
  <rule>Use ONLY information from the attached file.</rule>
</rules>

## 🧾 Normalized Output Format (Strict)
<format>
Produce ONE Markdown file: normalized_research1.md.

Each entry MUST follow EXACTLY this structure:
- Product
- Link
- Description of product
- Mechanism type
- Description of mechanism
- Acqusition
- jtbd
</format>

## 🧩 Canonical Template Requirement
<template>
The project contains a file: normalized_research_etalon.md.
This file is the CANONICAL FORMAT TEMPLATE.

Before producing any output:
- Open normalized_research_etalon.md
- Identify the exact structure

You MUST reproduce this structure EXACTLY for every extracted entry.

Any deviation from the template is forbidden:
- no renaming fields
- no reordering
- no extra fields
- no missing fields
</template>

## 🧭 Context
<context>
We study how products attract people who have NOT registered a business yet,
but are already thinking about launching one (pre-registration stage), to attract users to a B2B ecosystem or B2B product when they start their business.
</context>

## 🎯 Task
<goal>
Extract and normalize ALL EXPLICITLY DESCRIBED user acquisition mechanisms from the attached files raw_research1–20.pdf.
</goal>

## 📥 Inputs
<inputs>
  <files>raw_research1–20.pdf</files>
</inputs>

## ✅ Hard Rules
<rules>
  <rule>Write ONLY in Russian.</rule>
  <rule>Do NOT make conclusions, generalizations, or classifications.</rule>
  <rule>Do NOT group mechanisms.</rule>
  <rule>Do NOT improve wording.</rule>
  <rule>Do NOT add anything from yourself.</rule>
  <rule>If the source text contains uncertainty, keep it exactly as-is.</rule>
  <rule>Use ONLY information from the attached files.</rule>
  <rule>If the same data repeats in different files, duplicates are allowed.</rule>

## 🧩 Definition: “Acquisition Mechanism”
<definition>
Any explicitly described action, tool, format, channel, or product mechanism
through which a user first encounters the product BEFORE business registration.
</definition>

## 🛠 Instructions
<instructions>
  <step index="1">Read all attached files raw_research1–20.pdf.</step>
  <step index="2">Find ALL explicitly described acquisition mechanisms (per the definition above).</step>
  <step index="3">For each mechanism, create ONE separate atomic list item.</step>
  <step index="4">Do NOT merge, group, classify, or rewrite mechanisms.</step>
  <step index="5">If any field is not present in the source, leave it empty (do not infer).</step>
</instructions>

## 📄 Output Format (STRICT)
<output>
  <format>File nornalized_research.md In file: Bullet list. Each bullet = ONE atomic example. No other structure.</format>
  <item_template>
    - Product:
      [product name]

    - Product URL:
      [official website URL if present in the files]

    - Mechanism (as written in source):
      [verbatim or максимально близко к источнику]

    - Discovery:
      [how the user first encounters it, if stated]

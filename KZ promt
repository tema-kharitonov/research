## 🧩 JTBD Scenarios  
<jtbd>  
  <![CDATA[  
  For each niche:  
  - Core business “job”  
  - Context and triggers (frequency, regulatory requirements, risk, cost of errors)  
  - Alternatives (paper, Excel, email, Russian SaaS)  
  - Expected result (speed, risk reduction, resource savings)  
  - RU vs KZ differences (automation, UX, APIs, signatures)  
  - Sources: vendor websites (Documentolog, Uchet.kz, KYC.kz, Kompra), reviews (Softline, Directum), eGov, stat.gov.kz  
  ]]>  
</jtbd>  

## 🧪 Methodology  
<methodology>  
  <![CDATA[  
  - Analysis of vendor websites and documentation

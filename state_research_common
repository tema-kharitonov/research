# Execution Order
1. First, ask the user:
   “For which country should the research be conducted?”
2. Do NOT start the research until the user answers.
3. Execute each section strictly in order.
4. After completing each section:
   - Verify compliance with the rules in “How to Work with Data”.
   - If violations exist, correct the text immediately.
   - Do NOT write a separate correction block.
5. Only after verification proceed to the next section.
6. ❌ Do NOT use tables with more than 3 columns.

# How to Work with Data
1. First, use the predefined list of sources (if provided in the appendix).
2. If data is not available there, search reliable public sources.
3. Under no circumstances use fabricated data in sections without “Estimated!”.
4. You may use unverified estimates only if the section explicitly starts with “Estimated!”.
5. Always attach the source link immediately after each numerical value.
6. Use only 2023–2026 data.
7. If reliable data cannot be found, write:
   “данные не нашли, в результате не уверен”.

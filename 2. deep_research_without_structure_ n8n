Task:
Analyze a single product using input variables provided by n8n and return the result in a strict JSON schema.

Input (from n8n variables):
chatid {{$json.chatid}}
rsrchid {{$json.rsrchid}}
title {{$json.title}}
url {{$json.url}}
description {{ $json.description }}
analysis_object {{$json.deep}}
parameter_1 {{$json.par_1}}
parameter_2 {{$json.par_2}}
parameter_3 {{$json.par_3}}
parameter_4 {{$json.par_4}}

Instructions:
Read ALL input values strictly from n8n variables.
Do NOT invent, infer, extrapolate, or modify any input values.

The following fields MUST be copied verbatim from input to output:
chatid
rsrchid
title
url
description

Build research for the single product described by:
title
url
description

analysis_object describes a GENERAL acquisition or growth mechanism.

You must describe EXACTLY ONE concrete, real-world example of how this analysis_object
is implemented by the given product.

CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS (MANDATORY):
- Do NOT invent or speculate about mechanisms.
- Do NOT describe hypothetical, assumed, or “likely” tactics.
- Only describe a mechanism that is:
  a) explicitly mentioned in publicly available sources, OR
  b) directly observable on the product itself (website, onboarding, documentation, UI).

The described mechanism MUST be supported by one or more public sources.
If you cannot provide a confirming source link,
YOU MUST NOT include the example.

If no confirmed example exists, return an empty-but-valid JSON object
according to the schema rules below.

The example MUST be written inside the single string field "free".

Inside the example you MUST include the following sections
using EXACT headings (case-sensitive):

Example 1
description of the example analysis object
parameter_1
parameter_2
parameter_3
parameter_4
source

Write reasoning as plain text with clear headings.
Do NOT use markdown.

The field "example_analysis_object" in output MUST be copied verbatim
from the input variable analysis_object.

The output field "source" MUST contain ALL unique source URLs used
in the "free" field, combined into a single comma-separated string.
Do NOT add any extra sources that are not referenced in "free".

Output MUST match the JSON schema exactly.
Output ONLY valid JSON.
Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON object.

Return ONLY valid JSON. No apologies. No explanations. No markdown.

Output schema:
{
  "chatid": number,
  "rsrchid": number,
  "example_analysis_object": string,
  "free": string,
  "title": string,
  "url": string,
  "description": string,
  "source": string
}

Rules for field "free":
- Must be a single string
- MUST contain ONLY ONE example
- MUST follow this exact structure and order:
  Example 1
  description of the example analysis object
  parameter_1
  parameter_2
  parameter_3
  parameter_4

Rules for field "source":
- Must be a single string
- Must contain one or more public URLs
- URLs must confirm the mechanism described in "free"
- Multiple URLs must be separated by commas

chatid and rsrchid MUST be numbers, not strings.

If any required input value is missing or empty (including description):
- return valid JSON matching the schema
- set "free" to an empty string
- set "source" to an empty string
- do NOT include Example 1
- copy all other fields as-is from input

Never refuse, never apologize, never ask questions.

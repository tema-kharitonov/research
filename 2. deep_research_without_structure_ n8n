Task:
Analyze a single product using input variables provided by n8n and return the result in a strict JSON schema.

Input (from n8n variables):
chatid {{$json.chatid}}
rsrchid {{$json.rsrchid}}
title {{$json.title}}
url {{$json.url}}
description {{$json.description}}
analysis_object {{$json.deep}}
parameter_1 {{$json.par_1}}
parameter_2 {{$json.par_2}}
parameter_3 {{$json.par_3}}
parameter_4 {{$json.par_4}}

Instructions:
Read ALL input values strictly from n8n variables.
Do NOT invent, infer, extrapolate, or modify any input values.

The following fields MUST be copied verbatim from input to output:
chatid
rsrchid
title
url
description

Build research for the single product described by:
title
url
description

analysis_object describes a GENERAL acquisition or growth mechanism.

You must describe down to 3 CONCRETE real-world examples of how this analysis_object
is implemented by the given product.

CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS (MANDATORY):
- Do NOT invent or speculate about mechanisms.
- Do NOT describe hypothetical, assumed, or “likely” tactics.
- Only describe mechanisms that are:
  a) explicitly mentioned in publicly available sources, OR
  b) directly observable on the product itself (website, onboarding, documentation, UI).

EACH described mechanism MUST be supported by one or more public sources.
If you cannot provide a confirming source link for a mechanism,
YOU MUST NOT include that mechanism.

If fewer than 3 confirmed examples exist, return ONLY the confirmed ones.
Returning 1 example is acceptable.
Returning 0 examples is acceptable.

Each example must be a distinct, verifiable mechanism or tactic.
All examples MUST be written inside the single string field "free".

If multiple examples are provided, separate them clearly using numbered headings:
Example 1
Example 2
Example 3

Inside EACH example you MUST include:
- description of the example analysis object
- parameter_1
- parameter_2
- parameter_3
- parameter_4
- source (one or more URLs confirming this mechanism)

Write reasoning as plain text with clear headings.
Do NOT use markdown.

The field "example_analysis_object" in output MUST be copied verbatim
from the input variable analysis_object.

Output MUST match the JSON schema exactly.
Output ONLY valid JSON.
Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON object.

Output schema:
{
  "chatid": number,
  "rsrchid": number,
  "example_analysis_object": string,
  "free": string,
  "title": string,
  "url": string,
  "description": string,
  "source": string
}

Rules for field "free":
- Must be a single string
- Must contain clearly separated sections in the following order:
  Example 1
  description of example analysis object
  parameter_1
  parameter_2
  parameter_3
  parameter_4
  source
  (repeat structure for Example 2 / Example 3 if present)

Rules for field "source":
- Must be a single string
- Must contain one or more public URLs
- URLs must confirm the mechanisms described in "free"
- Multiple URLs may be separated by commas

chatid and rsrchid MUST be numbers, not strings.

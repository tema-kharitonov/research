Task:
Analyze a single product using input variables provided by n8n and return the result in a strict JSON schema.

Input (from n8n variables):
chatid {{$json.chatid}}
rsrchid {{$json.rsrchid}}
title {{$json.title}}
url {{$json.url}}
description {{$json.description}}
analysis_object {{$json.deep}}
parameter_1 {{$json.par_1}}
parameter_2 {{$json.par_2}}
parameter_3 {{$json.par_3}}
parameter_4 {{$json.par_4}}

Instructions:
Read ALL input values strictly from n8n variables.
Do NOT invent, infer, extrapolate, or modify any input values.

The following fields MUST be copied verbatim from input to output:
chatid
rsrchid
title
url
description

Build research for the single product described by:
title
url
description

analysis_object describes a GENERAL acquisition or growth mechanism.

You must describe AT MOST ONE CONCRETE real-world example of how this analysis_object
is implemented by the given product.

CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS (MANDATORY):
- Do NOT invent or speculate about mechanisms.
- Do NOT describe hypothetical, assumed, or “likely” tactics.
- Only describe mechanisms that are:
  a) explicitly mentioned in publicly available sources, OR
  b) directly observable on the product itself (website, onboarding, documentation, UI).

The described mechanism MUST be supported by one or more public sources.
If you cannot provide a highly reliable confirming source link,
you SHOULD return an empty result.

If no confirmed example exists:
- return an empty-but-valid JSON object following the schema
- set "free" to an empty string
- set "source" to an empty string

Rules for field "free":
- Must be a single string
- Must describe ONLY ONE example
- Must use the following structure and headings EXACTLY (case-sensitive):

Example 1
description of the example analysis object
parameter_1
parameter_2
parameter_3
parameter_4

Do NOT include source URLs inside "free".

Rules for field "source":
- Product pages such as pricing pages, onboarding flows,
official blogs, or help centers are valid confirming sources.
- Must be a single string
- Must contain one or more public URLs
- URLs must confirm the mechanism described in "free"
- Multiple URLs must be separated by commas
- Do NOT include sources that are not directly referenced by the example

The field "example_analysis_object" in output MUST be copied verbatim
from the input variable analysis_object.

Output MUST match the JSON schema exactly.
Output ONLY valid JSON.
Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON object.
No apologies. No explanations. No markdown.

Output schema:
{
  "chatid": number,
  "rsrchid": number,
  "example_analysis_object": string,
  "free": string,
  "title": string,
  "url": string,
  "description": string,
  "source": string
}

chatid and rsrchid MUST be numbers, not strings.

Never refuse.
Never ask questions.

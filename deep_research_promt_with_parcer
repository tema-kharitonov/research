## Context
<context>
A large B2B SaaS company in Russia is looking for ideas for products, channels, and services to attract entrepreneurs who have not registered a legal entity yet, but plan to do so soon.
</context>

## Research Goal
<goal>
Find real, working products, acquisition channels, communities, and services used worldwide to attract early-stage entrepreneurs (pre-registration stage).
</goal>

## Research Requirements
<requirements>
- Company facts must rely on trustworthy sources: official press releases, company websites, reputable news coverage, investor materials, or regulatory filings.
- The research must be maximally evidence-based.
- All conclusions must be derived strictly from data.
- If open data is not found, write: "данные не нашли, в результате не уверен".
- Every conclusion must include links to its data sources.
- The research and the final report must be written entirely in the Russian language.
</requirements>

<example>
Shopify has a brand identity builder to attract users even before they open an online store.
</example>

## 🔎 Niches to Analyze
<niches>
B2B SaaS for early-stage entrepreneurs (pre-registration).

## как исследовать

For each identified product, provide the following fields:

<product>
  <product_name></product_name>
  <product_url></product_url>
  <country></country>
  <revenue>If known; otherwise write "не известно"</revenue>

  <product_attraction_analysis>

    <definition>
Analyze all non-direct ways the product attracts and acquires users. A product may use multiple attraction mechanisms simultaneously.
    </definition>

    <research_rules>
- Do not assume attraction types upfront.
- Each attraction mechanism must be identified from evidence.
- Each mechanism must be analyzed independently.
- Classification is a conclusion, not an input.
    </research_rules>

    <attraction_mechanisms>

      <mechanism index="1">

        <discovery>
Describe how users first encounter this mechanism. Examples: content, integrations, referrals, ecosystem presence, community, data access.
        </discovery>

        <jtbd>
When I [context], I want [motivation], so that [expected outcome], I evaluate success by [measurable criteria].
        </jtbd>

        <effectiveness_analysis>
Assess:
- how well this mechanism converts attention into usage,
- friction level (time, money, trust),
- repeatability.
Use qualitative or quantitative signals if available.
        </effectiveness_analysis>

        <capacity_analysis>
Estimate:
- reachable audience size,
- scalability limits,
- dependency on partners, platforms, or regulation.
If data is missing, explicitly state uncertainty.
        </capacity_analysis>

        <attraction_type_classification>

          <analysis>
Based on discovery method, JTBD, and effectiveness, explain which attraction type best fits and why.
          </analysis>

Required if "other" is selected.
          </other_explanation>

        </attraction_type_classification>

        <evidence>
List sources, product pages, cases, or observable behavior that support this mechanism.
        </evidence>

      </mechanism>

      <!-- Repeat for mechanism 2, 3, ... -->

    </attraction_mechanisms>

    <synthesis>
Compare all identified mechanisms. Answer:
- which mechanisms are primary vs secondary,
- which scale best,
- which are defensible,
- which depend on external constraints.
    </synthesis>

## ✅ Definition of Done
<dod>
- At least 20 international examples of B2B SaaS products with non-direct acquisition channels.
- After the research, it should be possible to take attraction-mechanism ideas and reuse them to build similar mechanisms in Russia.
- Each mechanism includes links so a researcher can test how it works.
- The mechanisms can be prioritized to decide what to reproduce in Russia first.
</dod>

## ✅ Condition

## 📌 Rules & Requirements
<requirements>
  <![CDATA[
  1) Do NOT rewrite or edit any wording in the research except: figures and conclusions.
  2) Use the provided sources from the .md file first. If insufficient, you may add additional credible sources.
  3) For every figure or conclusion:
     - If confirmed by a source, update the final document with the sourced number/conclusion and cite the source.
     - If not confirmed, write: "не нашёл источник".
  4) Enrich the research with the total number of companies for the SMB segment (annual revenue 100M–2B RUB).
  5) Second-source check:
     - If a second source is NOT found, add the note: "данные только из одного источника".
     - If two sources differ by >20%, include BOTH sources and present BOTH values in the research text.
  6) All additions must be evidence-based with inline links or reference IDs to sources.
